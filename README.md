YouTube comments sentiment analysis

About this project
In this project, I developed a YouTube comment sentiment Web Application,The overall pipeline involved scraping comments from YouTube, followed by data preprocessing and feature extraction using TF-IDF. The Random Forest model was then trained 
on a labelled dataset to classify comments into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments. The 
trained model was integrated into a web application that allows users to input YouTube video 
URLs, scrape the comments, and visualize the sentiment results. This solution provides an 
intuitive and user-friendly way to understand the general sentiment expressed in YouTube 
comment sections
